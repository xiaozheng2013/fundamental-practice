Today, when I coded the data stucture- Stack, I find the usefulness of Template in c++.
Cause without Template, I have to specify the datatype to be stored in the stack, for 
instance in this case, the stack stores the node of the tree, next time if I have another
datatype need being DFS, I have to modify my stack class again in order for it to be 
usable.  What a depressing situation.
